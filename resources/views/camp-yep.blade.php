    The YEP (Youth Exchange Program) in the National Cadet Corps (NCC) is an initiative aimed at promoting cultural exchange, leadership development, and international cooperation among cadets. It provides an opportunity for cadets to interact with their counterparts from other countries, learn about different cultures, and broaden their perspectives on global issues.

During the YEP, cadets participate in various activities such as workshops, seminars, community service projects, and cultural exchanges. They engage in discussions on topics of mutual interest, collaborate on projects, and explore shared values and experiences.

The YEP not only fosters cross-cultural understanding and friendship but also cultivates leadership skills, communication abilities, and global awareness among cadets. It encourages them to become responsible global citizens who are equipped to contribute positively to their communities and the world at large.

Participating in the YEP is often a transformative experience for cadets, providing them with valuable insights, lifelong friendships, and a deeper appreciation for diversity and international cooperation. It reinforces the values of unity, peace, and cooperation that are central to the mission of the NCC and prepares cadets to be leaders in an increasingly interconnected and interdependentÂ world.

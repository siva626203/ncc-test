    <h5 class="lh-lg text-justify intent_text"> For NCC cadets, Camps are the most exciting and meaningful part of training, wherein cadets get exposure to the merits of NCC. Camps are organized at various levels i.e. Unit, Group HQ, Directorate and Republic Day (RD) Camp. These Camps serve to motivate the young students. NCC must conduct the Camps in an ingenious, pragmatic, transparent, flawless and efficient manner at all levels. A large number of dignitaries visit NCC Republic Day Camp an annual event for the NCC Cadets held at HQ DG NCC Camp at Delhi Cantonment. During this Camp Inter Directorate Competitions are conducted which contribute towards the award of prestigious Republic Day Banner. For such a prestigious Camp, modalities for conduct of the competition are well defined.
Republic day camp is organized and run under the total supervision of directorate general NCC. For this purpose, a republic day camp standing committee (RDC SC) under the overall supervision of the Addl Director General (B) is formed by August every year. RDC SC will be responsible to the Director General to organize and run the Republic Day Camp in accordance with these standing instructions.

Each NCC directorate sends a contingent to represent the directorate/state and Union Territories covered by it for the National Republic Day celebrations and to participate in RD Banner competitions and various functions/event of the NCC RD camp.

In Haryana, NCC cadets who participate in the Republic Day Camp at New Delhi are honoured by Hon'ble Governor with a cash prize of Rs. 21,000 (Rupees twenty one thousand only) along with Medal in a 'AT HOME' function organized immediately after the Republic Day Parade. One additional seat in all courses, over and above the sanctioned seats, is given to NCC cadets having ‘C’ Certificate and who have also attended the Republic Day (RD) Parade and Camp </h5>

    The IGC (Inter Group Competition) within the National Cadet Corps (NCC) is a platform for cadets to showcase their skills, teamwork, and competitive spirit. It involves various activities and events where cadet groups from different units compete against each other in a friendly yet challenging environment.

During the IGC, cadets participate in a wide range of competitions, including drill contests, obstacle courses, shooting competitions, map reading challenges, and cultural events. These competitions not only test the physical prowess and technical abilities of the cadets but also promote camaraderie, leadership, and sportsmanship.

The IGC fosters a sense of unity and healthy competition among cadets as they strive to excel in their respective disciplines and represent their units with pride. It provides an opportunity for cadets to learn from each other, develop teamwork skills, and build lasting friendships across unit boundaries.

Moreover, the IGC serves as a platform for recognizing and rewarding excellence among cadets. Winners of the various competitions are often awarded trophies, medals, or certificates in recognition of their achievements, motivating them to continue striving for excellence in their NCC journey.

Overall, the IGC is a vibrant and dynamic event that not only celebrates the talents and achievements of cadets but also reinforces the values of discipline, dedication, and camaraderie within the NCC community.
